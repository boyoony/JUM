# Under your working folder (/N/slate/by6/jum), you should have the following input files ready for JUM analysis ("*" indicates ctrl1, ctrl2, ctrl3, treat1, treat2 and treat3):
# *Aligned.out.sam files
# *SJ.out.tab files
# *Aligned.out_sorted.bam files


##### Running JUM_A.sh #####

# Make sure all the scripts are now in /N/slate/by6/JUM_3.0.0 
# Run JUM_A.sh (Make sure sample names for condition 1 (ctrl) is alphabetically before those for condition 2 (treat)). I set N2 as ctrl and adr-2(-) as treat. 

bash /N/slate/by6/JUM_3.0.0/JUM_A.sh --Folder /N/slate/by6/JUM_3.0.0 --JuncThreshold 5 --Condition1_fileNum_threshold 2 --Condition2_fileNum_threshold 2 --IRthreshold 5 --Readlength 100 --Thread 3 --Condition1SampleName ctrl_1,ctrl_2,ctrl_3 --Condition2SampleName treat_1,treat_2,treat_3

# JUM_A.sh will generate a new folder called JUM_diff/ with results for downstream analysis.



##### Running JUM_B.sh #####

# Make changes to the experiment design file before running Rscript 

cd /N/slate/by6/JUM_3.0.0/

vim experiment_design.txt 

i

      condition
ctrl_1 control
ctrl_2 control
ctrl_3 control
treat_1 treatment
treat_2 treatment
treat_3 treatment

ESC + Shift + ZZ

# The spaces should be all tab so that these are two different columns when opened in excel (I made an excel file myself to ensure this)

# Copy and paste this file into JUM_diff folder 

scp experiment_design.txt /N/slate/by6/jum/JUM_diff


# Enter the JUM_diff/ folder and run the R script with a user-provided experiment design file

cd JUM_diff/

module load bioconductor 

Rscript /N/slate/by6/JUM_3.0.0/R_script_JUM.R experiment_design.txt > outputFile.Rout 2> errorFile.Rout

# R_script_JUM.R will output a file called AS_differential.txt. Make sure that Step 2 successfully generates a new file called AS_differential.txt in the JUM_diff/ folder. Otherwise you can refer to the files outputFile.Rout and errorFile.Rout for troubleshooting  


# Now run JUM_B.sh in the JUM_diff/ folder as follows:

bash /N/slate/by6/JUM_3.0.0/JUM_B.sh --Folder /N/slate/by6/JUM_3.0.0 --Test pvalue --Cutoff 1 --TotalFileNum 6 --Condition1_fileNum_threshold 2 --Condition2_fileNum_threshold 2 --Condition1SampleName ctrl_1,ctrl_2,ctrl_3 --Condition2SampleName treat_1,treat_2,treat_3

# JUM_B.sh will generate a new folder called FINAL_JUM_OUTPUT_$Test_$Cutoff that contains the results for downstream analysis.



##### Running JUM_C.sh #####
