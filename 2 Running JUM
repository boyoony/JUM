# Under your working folder (/N/slate/by6/jum), you should have the following input files ready for JUM analysis ("*" indicates ctrl1, ctrl2, ctrl3, treat1, treat2 and treat3):
# *Aligned.out.sam files
# *SJ.out.tab files
# *Aligned.out_sorted.bam files


##### Running JUM_A.sh #####

# Make sure all the scripts are now in /N/slate/by6/JUM_3.0.0 
# Run JUM_A.sh (Make sure sample names for condition 1 (ctrl) is alphabetically before those for condition 2 (treat)). I set N2 as ctrl and adr-2(-) as treat.
